## Requirements

Our software is currently designed for the Linux terminal (any distro should work), and requires at least Python 3.7 installed.

We use PostgreSQL as our relational database management system.

As our program is a command-line application, the hardware requirements are extremely minimal, and will not be listed hereâ€”hardly a device exists that couldn't run the search engine.

## Usage

Simply start up a terminal window and navigate to the installation folder.

Run the following command to start the program, assuming you have Python 3 installed:

```
python3 airlines.py
```

## Advanced

Our search engine can be used in scripts for other programs; run the following command for more details:

```
python3 airlines.py -h
```
